## Generating an executable file
To generate an executable that can be run without having Python installed:
```
pyinstaller run.spec
```
(The file `run.spec` has been generated by pyinstaller and then manually modified 
to include a resource directory.) 

The executable has to be run from the terminal, and you have to cd into the
directory before executing it.
